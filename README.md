# Battle City Project
 Trial work on creating an analogue of Battle City.

 What is a project?
The project is a simple analogue of the game Battle City, which was created in 1 day. The project has a playable status and is available for viewing by anyone.

What has been implemented?
- The map is generated at the beginning of the game. The player and his base always spawn from the bottom of the arena (can be changed in the inspector).
- There are 2 types of enemies: fast - move faster than the player, heavy - require 2 shots to defeat them.
- Enemies constantly attack and move in random directions.
- There are 2 types of generated walls - destructible and non-destructible.
- After the player defeats all opponents - he wins the match.
The player has 3 lives. Life is taken away when an enemy is shot at the player. In this case, the player is created at the spawn point.
- For enemies, points are awarded, the amount of which can be seen during the game and at the end of the match.
- After the destruction of the player's base or his death, a loss occurs
- The game can be restarted without having to restart the game.
- There is a display of the number of player's lives and points received.
